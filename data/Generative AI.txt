Generative AI
Large Language Model (LLM)

Recap
----

- Trained on Human Language
- Predicts the next token (half word)
- Parameters 1B, 32B

How model is running?
-----
Take VLC player or the video players. It is an application to play videos
Videos are files in different format like .mp4, .mov, .mkv
We can play the video in VLC player by connecting to a screen with LCD, LED, OLED, multiple small LED panels.
Different screens support different clarity.
In the same way models are also files. Models can be stored in different file formats like gguf, safe tensors, bin.
TO run the model, we need an application, that were the ollama, llama.cpp, pytorch. Each application has its own advantage.
We can run the model in the application with infrastrucutre CPU, GPU, TPU, NPU similar to LED screens.
We can can use the ollama application to inference the model.
To reduce the size of the video file, we reduce the resolution.
In the same way, we reduce the precision values in the model to reduce the model size in inference.


New ML Beginner
------
Use Deep learning network framework like pytorch
Program your network architecture
Prepate the human language input - output pairs (Hi - Hello. How can I help you?) (Based on many use cases)
Train the neural network
Predict the next token (1 to 4 characters)


High level Overview of Generative AI
------

Training
Prompting RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Finetuning
Agent(Environment, Actions) [Logical Agent (my open source project) - Continuous learning]

Language Models
--------
Input to LLMs
Text only
Multimodal (Text, image, video, audio) - openai, gemini, claude, llama
Image focused prompting to capture more image details with prompting (generalized for all and an alternative to Image classification models (using CNN)) - florence

What can we do with Generative AI?
---------

Healthcare Diagnostics Assistance

Problem: Diagnosing diseases from medical imaging (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) requires significant expertise and time, often resulting in delays in treatment.

Solution using LLM: Utilize generative AI to analyze unstructured medical reports and imaging data, converting them into structured summaries with probable diagnoses and treatment recommendations. This accelerates decision-making and improves diagnostic accuracy.

----------

Legal Document Review

Problem: Reviewing lengthy legal documents in for compliance, errors, or critical clauses is time-consuming and prone to human oversight. (courts, public sectors, giving tenders more and more)

Solution using LLM: Apply generative AI to extract key terms, flag inconsistencies, and summarize large volumes of legal text accurately. This reduces the time required for contract reviews and ensures compliance.

----------

Supply Chain Optimization

Problem: Predicting disruptions in supply chains due to external factors (e.g., weather, geopolitical issues) is challenging.

Solution using LLM: Use generative AI to process unstructured data from news, weather reports, and logistics updates, converting it into actionable insights for better supply chain forecasting.

-----------

Employee Onboarding Automation

Problem: Onboarding new employees involves repetitive tasks and document processing, which can slow down productivity.

Solution using LLM: Use generative AI to automate onboarding documentation, answer common queries, and provide personalized onboarding plans for new hires.

-----------

Customer Support Automation

Problem: Handling large volumes of customer queries in real-time requires significant manpower, leading to delayed responses and inconsistent support quality. (specific to government policies, schemes, process, industry product support)

Solution using LLM: Deploy generative AI chatbots capable of understanding context, resolving customer issues, and escalating complex cases efficiently. These chatbots learn from past interactions, improving their responses over time.


--------------

Product Market Sentiment Analysis

Problem: Understanding market sentiment for specific products from reviews, competitor analysis, and social media is challenging due to the vast amount of unstructured text data.

Solution using LLM: Utilize generative AI to process customer reviews, competitor data, and social media discussions, converting them into actionable insights that help identify product strengths, weaknesses, and emerging market trends.
